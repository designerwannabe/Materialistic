## Welcome to Materialistic

Materialistic is a sample Material Design Version of Zurb Foundation I am currently experimenting.
Great shout out to [Eucalyptuss](https://github.com/eucalyptuss) for this dope design :heart_eyes:

### What does it do?

Basically, it consists of sample pages inspired by the Material Design in Foundation with customized colors and palettes
In specifics, it has:

* New Material Palettes
* Foundation Styles
* Material Design :heart_eyes:
* A lot of room to improve.  :confounded:

### Why did you made it?

Actually, it's for the sole purpose of experimenting and learning. I obviously love material design so I tend to explore stuffs.
Someone said it that experimenting is the key to success... right? :sob:
